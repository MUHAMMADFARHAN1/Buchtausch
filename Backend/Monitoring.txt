Monitoring:

threshold metrics like CPU utilization is more than 70% then send an alert as well.
L1 L2 monitor the infrastructure for anomaly.

datadog is for monitoring infrastructure.

AOM application performance management

splunk ca extract log from various tool and performance verz good visibility of infrastructure.

for network device we go for agentless, for server based we prefer agent based.

promethis uses PromQL to query the time series data.

service discovery, finds service and monitor them

3rd party have xporters collect metrics from the 3rd party components.

alert send to alert manager as well.

exporters , Prometheus becomes agent based, without agentless target it is agentless.

endpoints can be detectdd automitclaly in the sevrer and infratsryiure.

------------------------------------------------------------------
premetheurs retirvel parse the matrices endpoint, 

data sne dto time series database. flat file database

metric access is via htttp server, which cna access webgui or alert manager.

promethues can monitor a lot like server and services.
CPUS and exceptioncan also be monitorered as well.

what we need to monitor:
- load, response, error/exceptions
- python client libraries on app sevrer,and python metrics nad be scraped by Prometheus using endpoint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- service now tool. slack channel as well.
- splunk is metricd, aws has cloudwatch.
- Grafana is a visualization tool.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- push rrequest and scrapping metrics form the tagr, promethus.
-  prometheiues will create CRD for each pod inside the Kubernetes.
- service monitor attaches to the pod
- pull based scraping form the targets is done as well.


matrics and types of premtheus
- counter: increasing and how fast is it. never decreases. 
- gauge: it cna increase and decreases both, active connection cna increase or decrease as well. based on load it changes, point in time values like memory and CPU.
- histogram: shows history of data, gives both count and sum of observations as well. 
- summary: quantiles over sliding window we get here. it is best for percentiles as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pull/Push:
- Push SNMP trap and ICMP scho is push tech
- agent based is pull tech, while other is push. Prometheus can be both in pull and push.
- ping ICMP (TCP protocol) server or end device, SNMP MIB file on target device and all metrics info will be collected by the SNMP automated.
MIB - Management Informaiton Base
- ICMP uses ping, SNMP uses trapsm while MIB is manufactuerer specific.

SNMP traps are object ds.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prometheus doesnot have automated correlation engine built-in, label based matchng can be done in Prometheus as wlel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2 on Prometheus:
-wheel group users had extra privilages as well.
- sudo su - Prometheus, switch user to Prometheus
- 9090 was opened in the security group
- Prometheus service file, for resets of the system as well.
- check Prometheus config file, promtool check config Prometheus.yml file.
- success valid prometeus config file.
- exporers will b needed in others sevrer to get datat from there as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
second senario:
monitor docker sing prometheus.
- multiple containers dockercompos, sarm is dockerswam.
- protoo check config promethues.yml to check stuff
- /metrics scaring endpoint for preoetheus

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lab 3:
- we neededto setup th node exporter for this lab.
- node eport endpoint will be srapped by Prometheus as well.
